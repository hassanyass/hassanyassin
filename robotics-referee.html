                <div class="project-narrative">
                    <p>I volunteered as a Referee at the FIRST Global Challenge Malaysia, a prestigious international
                        robotics competition that brings together young innovators from around the world to solve global
                        challenges through engineering and teamwork. The Malaysian winning team earned the opportunity
                        to represent the country at the FIRST Global Robotics Competition, making the event both highly
                        competitive and impactful.</p>
                    <p>In my role as a referee, I was responsible for ensuring fair play, accurate rule enforcement, and
                        smooth match execution throughout the competition. This required sustained focus, rapid
                        situational analysis, and impartial decision-making in fast-paced, high-pressure match
                        environments where outcomes could change within seconds. Clear communication and consistency
                        were essential to maintain trust among teams, judges, and organizers.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the operational responsibilities, the experience offered a front-row perspective into the
                        creativity, collaboration, and technical problem-solving skills of young robotics teams.
                        Observing how participants combined mechanical design, programming, and strategic thinking under
                        time constraints was deeply inspiring and reinforced my belief in the transformative role of
                        robotics and STEM education in shaping future leaders and innovators.</p>
                    <p>This role challenged me to remain composed under pressure, manage conflicting viewpoints fairly,
                        and make confident decisions based strictly on established rules and observed evidence. It
                        strengthened my ability to operate effectively in dynamic, high-stakes environments, a skill
                        that directly translates to engineering leadership, technical evaluation, and real-world system
                        validation scenarios.</p>
