                <div class="project-narrative">
                    <p>I was awarded Second Place at the Melaka AI Hackathon, a competitive, time-constrained innovation
                        event focused on applying Artificial Intelligence to real-world problems. The award was achieved
                        through the development of Eat-In-Sight, an AI-powered Telegram bot designed to promote
                        healthier eating habits through intelligent automation and computer vision.</p>
                    <p>Eat-In-Sight enables users to simply upload an image of their meal via Telegram. The system
                        analyzes the image using AI-based image understanding techniques to identify food components and
                        estimate nutritional values, including macronutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
                        Based on this analysis, the bot generates a structured meal breakdown that is easy for users to
                        understand and act upon.</p>
                    <p>Beyond analysis, the solution focuses strongly on automation and long-term habit building. Each
                        analyzed meal is automatically logged into a Notion calendar, allowing users to track their
                        dietary patterns over time, review past meals, and reflect on their nutritional consistency. The
                        automation pipeline was built using n8n, showcasing how AI systems can be seamlessly integrated
                        into existing productivity tools to reduce friction and manual effort.</p>
                    <p>This project demonstrated how computer vision, workflow automation, and user-centric AI design
                        can work together to transform everyday health decisions into data-driven insights. It also
                        highlighted the importance of designing AI systems that fit naturally into users’ daily routines
                        rather than adding complexity.</p>
                    <p>From a personal and professional perspective, this experience significantly reshaped my
                        understanding of automation and applied AI. It reinforced the mindset of continuous learning,
                        unlearning outdated assumptions, and adapting quickly to emerging technologies, especially under
                        hackathon-level pressure. The project was inspired by Eng. Ahmed Abo Zaid and brought to life
                        through strong teamwork and collaboration with my colleagues, emphasizing the value of rapid
                        execution, clear communication, and shared problem-solving in high-impact AI development.</p>
