🏁 Referee – FIRST Global Challenge Malaysia

Organization: FIRST Global
Date: July 2025 (1 Month)

I volunteered as a Referee at the FIRST Global Challenge Malaysia, a prestigious international robotics competition that brings together young innovators from around the world to solve global challenges through engineering and teamwork. The Malaysian winning team earned the opportunity to represent the country at the FIRST Global Robotics Competition, making the event both highly competitive and impactful.

In my role as a referee, I was responsible for ensuring fair play, accurate rule enforcement, and smooth match execution throughout the competition. This required sustained focus, rapid situational analysis, and impartial decision-making in fast-paced, high-pressure match environments where outcomes could change within seconds. Clear communication and consistency were essential to maintain trust among teams, judges, and organizers.

Beyond the operational responsibilities, the experience offered a front-row perspective into the creativity, collaboration, and technical problem-solving skills of young robotics teams. Observing how participants combined mechanical design, programming, and strategic thinking under time constraints was deeply inspiring and reinforced my belief in the transformative role of robotics and STEM education in shaping future leaders and innovators.

This role challenged me to remain composed under pressure, manage conflicting viewpoints fairly, and make confident decisions based strictly on established rules and observed evidence. It strengthened my ability to operate effectively in dynamic, high-stakes environments, a skill that directly translates to engineering leadership, technical evaluation, and real-world system validation scenarios.
