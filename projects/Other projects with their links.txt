**[DEVELOPER/AI INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAYOUT]**
* Design this as a compact, multi-column grid at the bottom of the Projects page.
* Do not use heavy images here. Use clean typography and small, colorful pill-shaped badges for the tech stack (e.g., green for Python, blue for C++).
* Add a small GitHub icon next to each link.
