# PROJECT PROFILE: PATH TO HIRE
**Subtitle:** AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform & Career Coach
**Role:** Backend Engineer & API Integration Lead
**Vibe:** Growth Mindset, EdTech, Engineering Resilience

## 1. THE PROBLEM (Human Impact)
Countless talented candidates fail to land jobs not because they lack the technical skills, but because they lack interview practice. Generic interview prep is ineffective because it doesn't account for a candidate's specific seniority level, tech stack, or industry. 

## 2. THE SOLUTION (The Empathetic Engineer's Approach)
PathToHire is a personalized AI companion that democratizes high-quality interview coaching. Built during the SalamHack Hackathon, the platform ingests a user's CV and career goals to generate a hyper-realistic, fully customized interview simulation. It adapts dynamically to your professional field and experience level, offering structured feedback to help you improve.

## 3. TECHNOLOGIES USED (Display as Tags)
* Python
* Flask
* JavaScript
* RapidAPI
* Generative AI (Hugging Face)
* PythonAnywhere (Deployment)

## 4. HOW IT WORKS (The Backend Pipeline)
The core of this project was mastering complex API orchestration:
* **Dynamic Ingestion:** The backend parses the candidate's CV data.
* **Generative Questioning:** Using RapidAPI and Hugging Face LLM models, the system generates adaptive technical and behavioral questions tailored to the user's exact profile.
* **Evaluation Engine:** The AI evaluates the candidate's responses in real-time and delivers structured, constructive feedback on areas for improvement.

## 5. ENGINEERING RESILIENCE (Key Takeaways)
Software engineering is about persistence. During this hackathon, our team faced countless failed API integrations—from wrestling with RapidAPI endpoints to fine-tuning Hugging Face models and navigating PythonAnywhere deployment hurdles. We learned more from these failures than from our immediate successes, resulting in a robust, functional backend architecture. 

## 6. TEAM & RECOGNITION
Developed for the **SalamHack Hackathon**, this project was brought to life alongside my dedicated engineering partners, Fadul Osman and Mohamed Doma. This MVP is just the beginning of a larger vision to help job seekers succeed.
