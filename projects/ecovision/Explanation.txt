# PROJECT PROFILE: ECOVISION AI
**Subtitle:** Intelligent Waste Sorting Ecosystem for Smart Cities
**Role:** AI/ML Engineer & Backend Developer
**Vibe:** High-Tech, Sustainable, Impact-Driven

## 1. THE PROBLEM (Human Impact)
Urban waste management is inefficient, expensive, and currently relies on human workers performing hazardous manual labor in unsanitary conditions. While computer vision has the potential to automate this, real-world waste facilities present complex challenges: overlapping items, poor lighting, and dirty materials that confuse standard AI models.

## 2. THE SOLUTION (The Empathetic Engineer's Approach)
EcoVision AI is a fully integrated, web-based intelligent waste recognition system. It bridges the gap between complex computer vision models and practical environmental management. Designed for deployment on energy-efficient edge hardware (like the NVIDIA Jetson Nano), it turns ordinary recycling bins into interactive "Smart Bins."

## 3. TECHNOLOGIES USED (Display as Tags)
* Python
* Flask (Backend)
* OpenCV (Image Processing)
* YOLOv8 (Real-time Object Detection)
* MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
* TensorFlow

## 4. HOW IT WORKS (The ML Pipeline)
To ensure industrial-grade robustness, I architected a multi-stage ML pipeline:
* **Advanced Preprocessing:** Utilizing Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Canny edge detection to force the model to focus on structural geometry rather than color or lighting artifacts.
* **Dual-Engine Architecture:** 1. A MobileNetV2 engine focuses on precise validation of individual items to ensure high-purity recycling streams.
  2. A YOLOv8-based inventory mode identifies and tallies multiple overlapping waste items within complex scenes.

## 5. KEY METRICS (Highlight these in #EC4067 Pink)
* **87.53% Accuracy:** Achieved in classifying five major waste categories (Aluminium, Carton, Glass, Paper, Plastic) using MobileNetV2.
* **93.00% Precision:** Reached on transparent Glass items, a notoriously difficult material for AI to classify.
* **0.9918 mAP@50:** Achieved by the YOLOv8n multi-object detection model for high-throughput inventory tracking.

## 6. USER INTERFACE
The system features a Flask-based graphical user interface (GUI) with a responsive dashboard and drag-and-drop functionality. This enables non-technical stakeholders to conduct real-time sorting and inventory tracking without writing a single line of code.

## 7. FUTURE IMPACT
This technology lays the foundation for scalable, AI-powered waste-sorting ecosystems that improve recycling efficiency, protect human workers, and support the circular economy in smart cities.
