For the Past few months I have been observing the hype of n8n & Automation, where I didn’t see any benefit from it and thought it was just another AI trend, but that completely changed today🌓.

Today I am proud to share with you that, we took the second place 🥈 at the Melaka AI Hackathon ⭐️. Yesterday we had the chance to learn automation & n8n. And today after a long run 🏃‍♂️ we made it 🎉 🎊.

Introducing to you Eat-In-Sight 🍔 📸. Your new health and eating habit assitant, a telegram bot that you simply :
- Send a picture of your meal 🥘 
- Analyze the picture and extract the macros from it 🥢
- Send you a full detailed description of what this meal contains from (carbs, protein..etc) 
- Take this data and add it to your notion calendar 🗓️ so you can view it later on.

The idea 💡 was organized taken from Eng. Ahmed Abo zaid, a really inspiring person to me and to many of my colleagues .

And speaking about my colleagues I want to express my gratitude to my colleague Fadul Osman who was the backbone of this project & to Mohamed Doma and Youssef Ismail where was in another team but couldn’t stop helping us delivering this valuable project.
