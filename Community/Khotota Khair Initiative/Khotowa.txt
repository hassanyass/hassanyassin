🌱 Founder & Initiative Lead – Khotota Khair Initiative

Organization: Khotota Khair Initiative
Duration: February 2022 – Present
Sector: Social Services

I founded Khotota Khair Initiative as a community-driven social initiative aimed at providing discreet and dignified support to families facing financial hardship—particularly those who do not actively seek help despite genuine need. The initiative was built on the principle of preserving dignity while delivering meaningful, targeted assistance through trusted community channels.

The initiative began during Ramadan 2022, where food supplies were successfully delivered to 20 families through grassroots fundraising and direct coordination. In the following year, the initiative expanded to support 30 families, demonstrating sustainable growth driven entirely by community engagement, student involvement, and transparent resource management.

As the initiative matured, its scope expanded beyond seasonal support, evolving into a year-round effort that responds to urgent cases and diverse community needs. This included identifying beneficiaries, prioritizing assistance, coordinating logistics, managing distributions, and ensuring timely delivery—all while maintaining discretion and respect for recipients.

In my role as Founder & Initiative Lead, I oversaw the initiative end-to-end, including fundraising strategy, volunteer coordination, supplier communication, logistics planning, and on-ground execution. I actively engaged with students and local communities to raise awareness, mobilize resources, and foster a culture of social responsibility and collective impact.

This experience significantly strengthened my leadership, organizational, and operational management skills, while also shaping my ability to communicate with empathy, manage limited resources effectively, and make responsible decisions under real-world constraints. More importantly, it deepened my understanding of human-centered problem solving, reinforcing the value of compassion, trust, and accountability in creating sustainable impact.
